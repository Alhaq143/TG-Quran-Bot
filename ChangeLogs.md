# All Changes and Modifications that have been made to the project
**Newer Changes are on top**



## 2) 2nd July, 2023
- `/surah` command added. So, you can get any verse by doing `/surah <surah name>:<verse number>`
- Example: `/surah 1:2`

- Changed Folder Structure. Added `ChangeLogs` and `TODO` files. Now the project is more organized.


## 1) 1st July, 2023
- User can just send any surah name and the bot will send at most 3 options to choose from.
- The options will be the most relevant surahs that matches the user's given name.
- Example: `Fatiha` will give `1 Al-Fatihah`, `20 Taha` and `48 Al-Fath` as options. But `Fatihah` will only give `1 Al-Fatihah` as option. The capitalization from the user doesn't matter.


## Previous Logs have not been kept. Sorry for the inconvenience.
